/*
This is the RTMChub's library that contains the functions that are associated 
with what otherwise would be contained in the main program. It contains the 
interrupt routines, the functions to select if the hub is sending or receiving, 
the enums for the state machine and the struct for the handling the interrupts. 
Also, the functions located in the ino-file are declared here.
