/*
This is the RTMCnode's library that contains the functions that are associated 
with what otherwise would be contained in the main program. It contains the 
interrupt routine for the trigger-impulse, functions to enable and disable the 
interrupt and the enums for the state machine. It also contains declarations
for the functions located in the ino-file.
